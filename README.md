#### Planned Features / ToDo

- [x] Reflection system
- - [ ] constructors
- - [x] Methods
- - [x] Properties
- [ ] Asset manager (inspired by the truth)
- [ ] ECS or EC (unsure atm).
- [ ] C# scripting or Node base (unsure atm)
- [ ] Semi-RHI
- [ ] Dynamic Editor (via the reflection)
#
##### Ideas for the engine

###### - Vulkan renderer (+ opengl):
After ive finished the asset manager i will continue dev on my personal vulkan renderer.
After that I am hoping to write a RHI so that i can support multiple graphic api's

###### - C# as scripting lang
I really like C# and i would like to have it as my scripting lang.
However ive learned that implementing C# is a PITA, but im hoping that my new reflection system will make my life easier.

###### - Physics engine
In the past ive used PhysX, bullet and reactphysics3d. But i dislike all 3.
I have heard lots of good stuff about Joltphysics and i might give it a try for this engine.

###### - Audio Engine
Ive never really done much with audio, but ive seen the steam audio api and im hoping to try it!

###### - Editor GUI
For the editor il be using IMGUI since ive lots of experience with it.
However this time around i would like to modify the feel of imgui.

###### - Game GUI
At this point what i will use is far away, but i would either want something to functions like remUI.
But i could also end up writing my own (IF i were to write my own GUI lib the editor will use that instead of imgui).
