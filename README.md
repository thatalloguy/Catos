## Current Features:

### reflection system
Catos uses/depents allot on its own custom reflection system. The system is written across: registry.h, typeinfo.h, property.h, method.h
The reflection system support any fundemental type and some special types, such as `catos::vector` and `std::unordered_map` .

### Automatic python binding.
Powered by its reflection system, Catos can automatically bind cpp class with properties and functions to python.

### Serialization system.
Powered by the reflection system, Catos can write most cpp classes to both yaml and binary(WIP). 
It can also later read them back from yaml and binary. Yaml is meant to be used for the editor so that any errors/corrupted files can be easily read and fixed.
Binary is for exported games and meant for loading objects fast.

### Modern renderer.
Catos's renderer is meant to be customizable at heart. The current renderer is written ontop of opengl and allows the user to easily create their own `Pipelines` and `RenderPasses` .
However the plan is to migrate from opengl to SDL_GPU, which is a relatively thin layer ontop of both DirectX12, Vulkan and Metal. This will recuire me to rewrite the entire render structure.
This is because SDL_GPU already has `RenderPasses` and `Pipelines` out of the box. The implementation will be focused on ease of customization with the help of nodes, which is meant to function as a framegraph.
Allowing the user to specify what shaders, pipelines, buffers, textures and passes should be used and how. With the introduction of SDL_GPU it also means that we can't use GLSL but only HLSL, I intend to write a small validation layer (if needed) and then use SDL_Shadercross to compile them.

### Window management.
The current windowing library is GLFW-3, however with the introduction of SDL_GPU I see no reason to stay with GLFW and therefor I will migrate to SDL 3.
