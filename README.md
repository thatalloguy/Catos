## Current Features:

### reflection system
Catos uses/depents allot on its own custom reflection system. The system is written across: registry.h, typeinfo.h, property.h, method.h
The reflection system support any fundemental type and some special types, such as `catos::vector` and `std::unordered_map` .

### Serialization system.
Powered by the reflection system, Catos can write most cpp classes to both yaml and binary(WIP). 
It can also later read them back from yaml and binary. Yaml is meant to be used for the editor so that any errors/corrupted files can be easily read and fixed.
Binary is for exported games and meant for loading objects fast.

### Modern renderer.
Catos's renderer is meant to be customized for any situation. Instead of being a out of the box solution its more of a dynamic framework, with which the user can create their own render pipelines and passes.

### Error codes and their meanings:
- 200-299 are codes from the player
- 100-199 are codes from the core engine
- 300-399 are codes from the editor
